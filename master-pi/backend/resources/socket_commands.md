# Sockets Commands

## How To Use

When Sending a request to the master pi though sockets, the socket handler reads a single message that has the command and payload. The message may be sent in multiple partitions depending on size, the message is split as following:

```python
message = {
    "command": command: str,
    "payload": payload: json{}
}
```

For an example lets use the Add Booking command, taken from the API documentation we need the request body to have:

```json
{
  "email": "string",
  "scooter_id": "integer",
  "start_datetime": "string (ISO 8601)",
  "end_datetime": "string (ISO 8601)",
  "cost": "float"
}
```

The command to add a booking is "AB" taken from the table below, to send this through sockets from the agent pi to the master pi the message needs to look like this to be succesfully read and handled by socket_handler:

```python
message = {
    "command": "AB",
    "payload": {
        "email": "test@mail.com",
        "scooter_id": 1,
        "start_datetime": "Sun, 01 Sep 2024 10:00:00 GMT",
        "end_datetime": "Sun, 01 Sep 2024 10:30:00 GMT",
        "cost": 15.00
    }
}
```

The socket handler always returns a json message back, this is either a success, error message or in the case of requesting data a json format just like the payload in the above code but without the command.
